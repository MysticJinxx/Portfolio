## About Me
I am a Software Developer, Game Developer and graduate of The Tech Academy. I also have a Bachelor's in Animation from Full Sail University, which I plan to use when making assets for my games. I have a wife and a little girl, whom I love to go adventuring with. The above link will take you to my Portfolio Website, where you can delve into my past projects a bit, or contact me using the form!

## About The Website
The Portfolio site was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It started off with almost nothing on it, as I was learning HTML and CSS. As I learned more, I was able to add some cooler things. Such as the slideshow, navbar, and contact form. My favorite part of this project was learning how to make an automatic transitioning slideshow. The JavaScript included in this project makes the Slideshow function as well as opening/closing the contact form. There's also a nice little eventListener in there that makes the contact form close if the user clicks off of it.
